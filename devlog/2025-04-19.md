* A command-line tool, `devlog`, is created to generate daily development logs.
* It uses Git to track code changes.
* It leverages Gemini's API for summarizing code diffs into natural language.
* Summaries are appended to daily Markdown files in a `devlog/` directory.
* The tool is modular, with separate modules for Git interaction, Gemini API calls, and file logging.
* It's extensible, allowing for custom prompts and data sources.
* Prerequisites include Node.js, Git, and a Gemini API key.
*  Custom diff ranges and prompts are supported.
*  Integration with C++ is possible for performance improvements.
